Hurt Sounds
==============

A simple add-on for Garry's Mod that makes the player say "Ah, I'm hurt!" when they are low on health.

To install, simply place the addon folder inside the zip file in your servers garrysmod/addons directory.

To customise this add-on, simple edit the customsation options at the top of sv_init.lua.
